# Pure-Pursuit
A pure pursuit simulator for windows

This code was created for the VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) as practice for working with the algorithm.
Currently, the algorithm is under development as I learn how to program it
Once it is complete, it will be capable of assisting with planning routes
